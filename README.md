## Summary

### What I learned

- Practiced utilizing the ASCII chart to identify characters and using String.fromCharCode() to convert the character code to the respective character
- When submitting a form, used event.preventDefault() to disable the default behavior of reloading a page and wiping out the user's option selections and generated password
- Avoid using magic numbers (a number in code that seems arbitrary and has no context or meaning), which was put into practice with the ASCII chart codes; instead of inputing the ASCII numbers directly, created an ascii object with the ASCII ranges

### Project Summary

- Created a random password generator that allows a user to customize the following options:
  - Password Length: # of characters (between 8 - 128)
  - Uppercase Characters: toggle to include/exclude
